# CCInsulinDelivery

CCInsulinDelivery is an iOS library designed to collect data from an insulin pump that complies with the insulin delivery service v1.0 specification. A sample sensor implementation is provided in the BLEIDSSim project (https://github.com/ehealthinnovation/BLEIDSSim)

A sample collector application is included to show usage of the CCInsulinDelivery library, which consists of data collection, a sample insulin delivery session, and optional uploading of data to a FHIR (DSTU3) server.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.
